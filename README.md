* ACM: All-Cause Mortality / All-Cause Mortality

### Target

* Steady live longer

### Key Results

* Reduced all-cause mortality by 66.67%
* Increase\~20 years life expectancy
* ~~Maintain dopamine in the central axis~~

### analyze

* Main reference: There are relatively many academic literature on ACM, which can be used as the main reference
* The relationship between increased life and ACM is nonlinear: Obviously, the relationship between increased life and ACM is a nonlinear function. Here we assume `DeltaLifeSpan=(1/(1+DeltaACM)-1)*10` (DeltaACM is the change value of ACM; the formula welcomes optimization)
* Variables cannot be simply superimposed: Obviously, the independent and identical distribution assumptions are not met between the variables, and the actual impact between the variables is not clear
* Contradictory viewpoints: All the evidences correspond to literatures/studies, but note: some literatures have significant conflicting viewpoints (such as the contradiction of carbohydrate intake ratio); Sleeping before increases all-cause mortality by 43%)
*Research only expresses correlation: all literature shows more correlation than causation, consider whether the literature fully proves causation when reading - for example, a literature shows that people with an average daily >=7000 steps have significantly lower all-cause mortality rate. However, people with fewer steps may include more long-term patients. If this data is not reasonably excluded, the literature survey will be distorted.

  * Spermidine is the most easily absorbed polyamine from the human gut. Spermidine is found in high amounts in many foods, such as fresh green peppers, wheat germ, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms and various cheeses, especially in soy products such as natto, shiitake mushrooms and durian. In this experiment, the researchers selected 829 participants aged 45-84 for a 20-year follow-up to analyze the potential association between dietary spermidine intake and human mortality.
  * Studies have found that women consume more spermidine than men, and that intake decreases with age. The main sources of spermidine were whole grains (13.4%), apples and pears (13.3%), salads (9.8%), sprouts (7.3%) and potatoes (6.4%). The study divided the population into three groups based on spermidine intake, low intake (<62.2 µmol/d), moderate intake (62.2–79.8 µmol/d), and high intake (>79.8 µmol/d). A total of 341 deaths were recorded during follow-up, including 137 from vascular disease, 94 from cancer, and 110 from other causes. The crude mortality rates for the low, middle, and high groups were calculated to be 40.5%, 23.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. These data indicate a significant inverse relationship between spermidine intake and all-cause mortality. The relationship remained significant with gradual adjustment for age, sex, and calorie ratios.

* [Subvert cognition! A Canadian study found that going to bed early may be more harmful than staying up late. What time is the best time to go to bed? ](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14461799)
  * One of the conclusions is that bedtime is strongly associated with all-cause mortality. Going to bed too early and going to bed too late can affect health, but early going to bed increases all-cause mortality more than late going to bed, and early going to bed increases increased the risk of death by 43%, while staying up late increased the risk of death by 15%.
  * There are still many limitations in this research study. For example, it does not directly prove the relationship between bedtime and death, but only shows the correlation. The data is not objective enough to count sleep time through self-report of the participants.

#### context

##### mood

* [pessimism is associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but optimism is not protective](https://www.x-mol.com/paper/1288184397379059712/t?recommendPaper =1263704526086578176)
  * In 1993-1995, the Life Orientation Test (LOT) was included in a study of healthy twins in Australians over the age of 50, which included items of optimism and pessimism. After an average of 20 years, participants were matched with death information from Australia's National Mortality Index. Of the 2,978 participants with many available scores, 1,068 died. Survival analyses tested associations between various optimism and pessimism scores and mortality from any cause, cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other known causes. Core on the age-adjusted pessimism scale was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation unit, 95% confidence interval and p-values ​​1.134, 1.065–1.207, 8.85 × 10–5 and 1.196, 1.045–1.368, 0.0093), but did not die from cancer. The correlation between optimistic and pessimistic scores was weak (age-adjusted rank correlation coefficient = −0.176), but not significantly associated with overall or cause-specific mortality. Reverse causality (diseases that cause pessimism) is not possible, because in that case both cardiovascular disease and cancer cause pessimism.

##### Rich and Poor

* [JAMA sub-issue: Can the gap between the rich and the poor really affect life expectancy? It might be true! ](https://www.cn-healthcare.com/articlewm/20210727/content-1246348.html)
  * The study used data first collected from 1994-1996 and used a survival model to analyze the association between net worth and longevity. RESULTS: A total of 5414 participants were included, with an average age of 46.7 years, including 2766 women. Higher net worth is associated with a lower risk of death. Among siblings and twins in particular (n = 2490), a similar association was observed between higher net worth and lower mortality, suggesting that siblings or twins with more wealth were less wealthy than those with less wealth Siblings/twins live longer.

##### weight

* [JAMA Sub-Journal: Lose weight as early as possible to effectively reduce the risk of mortality](https://www.chinacdc.cn/gwxx/202009/t20200904_218959.html)
  * Mortality risk assessment of weight loss found that adults who lost weight from obese to overweight had a 54% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with stable obesity (hazard ratio, 0.46), whereas weight loss from early adulthood to overweight to The risk of mortality was not reduced in the normal-weight population before middle age (hazard ratio, 1.12).

  * At present, the death rate of the new crown (US) is around 1.5%, and the average life expectancy has been reduced by 2 years
